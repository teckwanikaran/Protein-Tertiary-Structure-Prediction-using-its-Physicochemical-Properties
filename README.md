# Protein-Tertiary-Structure-Prediction-using-its-Physicochemical-Properties

The goal of this project is to:
  1. Perform exploratory data analysis and data pre-processing
  2. Build various regression models to predict the target attribute
  
The [data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Physicochemical+Properties+of+Protein+Tertiary+Structure) is open source and obtained from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) machine learning repository.

The Jupyter notebook has all the required code. All the images/visulization is stored in the Images folder. I have also uploaded the .csv file in the Data folder.
